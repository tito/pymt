Welcome to PyMT's documentation!
================================

PyMT is an open source library for developing multi-touch applications. It is
completely cross-platform (Linux/OSX/Win) and released under the terms of the
GNU LGPL.

It comes with native support for many multi-touch input devices, a growing
library of multi-touch aware widgets, hardware accelerated OpenGL drawing,
and an architecture that is designed to let you focus on building custom and
highly interactive applications as quickly and easily as possible.

Thanks to PyMT's pure Python interface, you can take advantage of its highly
dynamic nature and use any of the thousands of high quality Python libraries
out there.
At the same time, performance-critical sections are internally implemented
on the C-level to maximize performance.

See http://pymt.eu for more information.
