Welcome to PyMT's documentation!
================================

PyMT is a Python library for developing NUI (new user interfaces, including multi-touch) enabled media rich applications.

The goal of PyMT is to provide a framework for quick and easy interaction design with a focus on rapid prototype development.

There is also a focus on logging tasks and sessions of user interaction to quantify data and allow the analysis and visualization of such data.
